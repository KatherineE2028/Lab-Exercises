Lab 6
#The program prompts the user to enter their name and a number. 
#It then attempts to convert the input number into a floating-point format in case the user entered a decimal. 
#If an invalid input is found (ValueError) an error message is printed.
#If the conversion is successful, the program calculates the square of the number. 
#Finally, it outputs a message that includes the user's name and result.  
#The program outputs the name, original number, and the number squared.
